## Linux notes

Some notes also apply to BSD systems.

### Linux development environment in ChromeOS

Linux containers and VMs for ChromeOS are made available via the
[Crostini](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/containers_and_vms.md)
framework.

More information can also be found on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/).

- **Enabling**: Go to
  `Settings > Developers (under Advanced) > Linux Development Environment`
  and enable
- **Terminal settings**: `Ctrl-Shift-p` in the Linux terminal
- **Interacting with the Wayland clipboard**: Copying and pasting in
  and out of the Crostini container via the Wayland clipboard in
  ChromeOS (Wayland is the display manager) can be done using
  [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) (see
  [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/kf3fxo/linux_beta_penguin_how_to_copy_file_contents_from))
  version `2.0.0` or greater (note that the Crostini terminal has
  native support for the Wayland clipboard, in that selecting a region
  will copy to the clipboard and `Ctrl-Shift-v` will paste from the
  clipboard)
- **Flatpak issues**: Flatpak may need security nesting enabled to run
  properly. If not enabled, errors may surface like the following.

  ```console
  $ flatpak run org.some.program
  bwrap: Can't mount proc on /newroot/proc: Operation not permitted
  error: ldconfig failed, exit status 256
  ```

  To enable security nesting, in ChromeOS do `Ctrl-Alt-t` to open
  a crosh terminal, run

  ```sh
  vsh termina
  lxc config set penguin security.nesting true
  ```

  and restart the computer so the new setting takes effect.

## Mac notes

### Basic CLI development environment using conda

Conda can provide a basic CLI dev environment without XCode or its command-line
tools installed. Some conda packages for this:

- `bat`
- `clang`
- `gawk`
- `git`
- `go`
- `htop`
- `postgresql`
- `python` and many packages in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
- `r-base` and some [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) packages
- `ripgrep`
- `sed`
- `vim`
- `visidata`

Notes:

- R packages begin with an `r-` prefix but only popular packages are available
- Conda has an `emacs` package, but go with one of the standalone Emacs
  applications ([Emacs for Mac OSX](https://emacsformacosx.com/) or the
  [emacs-mac port](https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport)) as they
  are better integrated with the system

#### Installation

Mambaforge. Assumes `$HOME/.local/bin` is in `$PATH` and `$HOME/.zshrc` exists.

```sh
# Install mambaforge for faster operations
# $ chmod +x Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh
# $ ./Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh                     # interactive install
# $ eval "$(~/mambaforge/bin/conda shell.zsh hook)"  # modify path as needed
# $ conda init
# $ conda config --set auto_activate_base false
# $ mamba init
# Create basic tools environment rather than polluting base environment
mamba create -n myenv
mamba activate myenv
mamba install bat git htop ripgrep tmux
cd $HOME/.local/bin
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/myenv/bin/bat .
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/myenv/bin/git .
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/myenv/bin/htop .
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/myenv/bin/rg .
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/myenv/bin/tmux .
mamba deactivate
# Create new environments as needed for each project, e.g.
# > mamba create -n some-project python=3.9
```

#### LaTeX tools setup

Use Tectonic for LaTeX compilation.

As of Jan 2022, there are no Pandoc binaries packaged for Darwin
aarch64 (although Homebrew offers an option), so alternatives are
listed below.

```sh
mamba create -n latextools
mamba activate latextools
mamba install tectonic
mamba deactivate
cd $HOME/.local/bin
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/latextools/bin/tectonic .
```

#### Ruby tools setup

Setup useful Ruby tools.

- Asciidoctor for processing Asciidoc files, with extensions for
  conversion to PDF, PDF optimization and syntax highlighting
- Kramdown for processing Markdown files (of the Kramdown flavor), as
  well as a converter to Asciidoc

```sh
mamba create -n rbtools
mamba activate rbtools
mamba install ruby
gem install asciidoctor
gem install asciidoctor-pdf rghost rouge
gem install kramdown kramdown-asciidoc
mamba deactivate
```

Create the following files with the given contents.

`$HOME/.local/bin/asciidoctor`:

```sh
#!/bin/zsh
source $HOME/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
source $HOME/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh
mamba activate rbtools
asciidoctor "$@"
```

`$HOME/.local/bin/kramdown`:

```sh
#!/bin/zsh
source $HOME/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
source $HOME/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh
mamba activate rbtools
kramdown "$@"
```

`$HOME/.local/bin/kramdoc`:

```sh
#!/bin/zsh
source $HOME/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
source $HOME/mambaforge/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh
mamba activate rbtools
kramdoc "$@"
```

Make the files executable so they are easy to run on the command-line.

```sh
cd $HOME/.local/bin
chmod +x asciidoctor
chmod +x kramdown
chmod +x kramdoc
```

#### Python development setup

Environment-independent Python development tools.

```sh
mamba create -n pydevtools python=3.9
mamba activate pydevtools
mamba install jedi-language-server black
mamba deactivate
cd $HOME/.local/bin
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/pyenv/jedi-language-server
ln -s $HOME/mambaforge/envs/pyenv/black
```

#### Installing GPU ML libraries for darwin-aarch64 machines

Metal-enabled [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
([link](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/)),
currently supports Python `3.8` and `3.9`.

Note that `tensorflow-deps` versions follow base Tensorflow versions,
so if using Tensorflow `2.6.X`, install `tensorflow-deps==2.6.0`.

```sh
mamba create -n tfenv python=3.8
mamba activate tfenv
conda config --env --add channels apple
mamba install -c apple tensorflow-deps
pip install tensorflow-metal
pip install tensorflow-macos
```

Optional data.

```sh
pip install tensorflow-datasets
```

Check that tensorflow is using the GPU.
The following should return a non-empty list.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.config.list_physical_devices("GPU")
```

Upgrading Metal-enabled Tensorflow by uninstalling and re-installing.
Note that it is usually better to create a new environment and
installing from scratch there instead.

```sh
mamba activate tfenv
pip uninstall tensorflow-macos
pip uninstall tensorflow-metal
mamba install -c apple tensorflow-deps --force-reinstall
pip install tensorflow-metal
pip install tensorflow-macos 
```

### Installing XCode command-line tools

```sh
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install
```

### Running virtual machines with UTM on M1 Macs

Notes for using virtual machines via [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)
([Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM)) on M1 macOS machines.

#### Usage notes

- `Ctrl-Option` toggles "capture mouse cursor" (if using Emacs in the
  virtual machine, it is better to enable "Use Command+Opt for input
  capture/release" to change the `Ctrl-Option` binding to
  `Command-Option` instead in the UTM app preferences)
- The default networking mode for VMs is shared networking, in which
  the host machine acts as a virtual router for the virtual machine.
  Under this networking mode, run `ip addr` in the virtual machine to
  find the IP address of the virtual machine (which should look like
  `192.168.XXX.YYY`, and can used to ssh from the host into the VM).
  Using bridged mode is similar, except IP address allocation is
  deferred to the upstream router instead of using the host machine.
  For more info, see [link](https://kb.parallels.com/4948).
- If networking in the VM stops working, sometimes it is because the
  network configuration becomes invalid (e.g. if the MAC address
  changes). To temporarily re-acquire an IP address, first figure out
  the interface using `ip addr` (the name is something like `enp0s10`)
  and run `sudo dhclient <INTERFACE>` to (re-)acquire an IP address. A
  more permanent solution involves installing the `dhcpcd5` package
  which is a DHCP client daemon via `sudo apt install dhcpcd5` (for
  more info about this utility, see
  [here](https://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/)). See
  [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/534184/network-not-working-in-a-qemu-kvm-virtual-machine-running-arch-linux)
  for more info about this topic in general (dicussion is for
  ArchLinux but the concepts are similar)

- [OpenVPN 3 Linux](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/OpenVPN3Linux)

#### Debian install example

This assumes a fresh install of Debian (i.e., download the Debian
aarch64 ISO and use that to install a new VM in UTM).

```sh
apt install git
apt install spice-vdagent spice-webdavd
systemctl enable spice-vdagentd
apt install flatpak gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.gnu.emacs
flatpak install flathub org.jaspstats.JASP
flatpak install flathub org.chromium.Chromium
apt install openjdk-11-jre
```

Disable sleep and suspend by creating a file
`/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/nosuspend.conf` with the following
contents.

```ini
[Sleep]
AllowSuspend=no
AllowHibernation=no
AllowSuspendThenHibernate=no
AllowHybridSleep=no
```

Install OpenVPN 3 (replace `bullseye` with the appropriate distro per
[this](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/OpenVPN3Linux#DebianUbuntu)
table).

```sh
apt install curl stow
apt install apt-transport-https
curl -fsSL https://swupdate.openvpn.net/repos/openvpn-repo-pkg-key.pub | gpg --dearmor > /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openvpn-repo-pkg-keyring.gpg
curl -fsSL https://swupdate.openvpn.net/community/openvpn3/repos/openvpn3-bullseye.list >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/openvpn3.list
apt update
apt install openvpn3
```

Other software to download:

- [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)
- [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font (at least Aile,
  regular if needed)
- [DBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver) (community edition,
  aarch64-nojdk, make a copy of `dbeaver-ce.desktop` edited with the
  correct paths and save it to `$HOME/.local/share/applications/`)
- [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) (aarch64)

Config changes:

- In `Default Applications`, change the default browser to Chromium

#### Enabling retina resolution for Macbooks

Install `spice-vdagent` and `spice-webdavd` using the system package manager.

Make the following modifications to the VM settings.

> Edit > Display > Resolution > Enable "Fit to screen" and
> "Retina mode"

Modify UTM preferences (Command-,) so native solution is always used.

> Scaling > Enable "Always use native (HiDPI) resolution"

Run the virtual machine at fullscreen, and in the guest OS scale all
UI elements to 200% (the following is for a system running GNOME).

> Settings app > Displays > Scale > Set to 200%

#### Shared drives

Make the following modifications to the VM settings.

> Check "Enable Directory Sharing" in Edit > Sharing > Shared Directory

Attach a shared directory to the VM in the UTM admin window.

In the running VM session, the shared directory is available as a
WebDAV service at `http://localhost:9843` with no credentials needed.

This can be attached as a network drive in GNOME Files. Once the
network drive is attached, it is accessible either through a GNOME
application or the filesystem at some mounted directory within
`${XDG_RUNTIME}/gvfs/` (`$XDG_RUNTIME` is usually `/run/user/<USERID>`
and the mounted directory name is something like
`dav+sd:host=Spice%2520client%2520folder._webdav._tcp.local`).

Alternatively, it can be mounted to a directory using instructions
listed
[here](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/wiki/Useful-tips#mounting-webdav-shares)
(note that for an M1 machine, install the `davfs2` package rather than
the `dav2fs` package).

## GnuPG

### Exporting ASCII-armored keys as QR codes

First run `gpg --list-keys --with-subkey-fingerprint` to list the keys plus
subkeys along with their fingerprints. Identify the encrypting subkey, if one
exists, by the usage flag `[E]` (otherwise, create one or use the master key),
and note its fingerprint.

The subkey and the public key can be exported in ASCII-armored format to QR
code images as below (modifying appropriately `<KEY_EMAIL>` and
`<SUBKEY_FINGERPRINT_WITHOUT_SPACES>`).

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/keys-export && cd $_
# export public key to pubkey-??.qr QR code image files
gpg --export --armor <KEY_EMAIL> > pub.key
split -C 2500 pub.key pubkey-
for file in pubkey-??; do <"$file" qrencode -s 3 -d 150 -o "$file".qr; done
# export secret subkey to subkey-??.qr QR code image files
gpg --export --armor <SUBKEY_FINGERPRINT_WITHOUT_SPACES> > sub.key
split -C 2500 sub.key subkey-
for file in subkey-??; do <"$file" qrencode -s 3 -d 150 -o "$file".qr; done
```

The `*.qr` files can be viewed in a web browser, and scanned in as desired.
Delete the `/tmp/keys-export/` folder when done.

### Extending key expirations

1. Find the expiring key ID using `gpg --list-keys` (the key ID comes
   after the slash)
1. Edit the key using `gpg --edit-key KEY_ID`
1. View key and subkeys with the `list` command, where selected
   keys/subkeys have and asterisk next to them
1. Select/unselect a key using `key N` where `N` is the number of the
   desired key in the list
1. The command `expire` will allow the interactive selection of a new
   expiry.
1. Repeat as needed (may not be needed if multiple keys are selected
   and their expirations extended as above)
1. Check new expirations using `list`
1. Save with the `save` command
1. Publish/disseminate the updated keys as appropriate

Run `help` while in the GPG shell for additional commands available.

## Git

### Credentials using .netrc file

Many command-line tools integrate with `.netrc` files. It is possible
to use this together with GnuPG to create an encrypted version
`.netrc.gpg` and use it with Git.

Emacs
[auth-source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html)
users may want to use `$HOME/.authinfo` instead of `$HOME/.netrc`, in
which case references to `$HOME/.netrc` and `$HOME/.netrc.gpg` below
should be changed to `$HOME/.authinfo` and `$HOME/.authinfo.gpg`
respectively.


1. Get `git-credential-netrc` and put it somewhere on `$PATH`.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p $HOME/packages/git-credential-netrc
   cd $HOME/packages/git-credential-netrc
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/credential/netrc/git-credential-netrc.perl
   chmod +x git-credential-netrc.perl
   cd $HOME/.local/bin
   ln -s $HOME/packages/git-credential-netrc/git-credential-netrc.perl git-credential-netrc
   ```

1. Create a `$HOME/.netrc` file with credentials as follows.

   ```text
   machine some.server.com login some_login password some_password
   machine another.server.com login another_login password another_password
   ```

1. Create or import a GPG key (not shown here). Create an encrypted
   version of the credentials file `$HOME/.netrc.gpg` and delete the
   unencrypted version.

   ```sh
   gpg -e -r the_recipient $HOME/.netrc
   rm $HOME/.netrc
   ```

1. Configure git to use the encrypted credentials locally in a
   repository. Change `--local` to `--global` to use the encrypted
   credentials globally.

   ```sh
   git config --local credential.helper "netrc -f ~/.netrc.gpg -v"
   ```

   [here](https://grahamlopez.org/git/git_credentials.html) and
   [here](https://andrearichiardi.com/blog/posts/git-credential-netrc.html).

**NOTES**:

- Requires Perl with the Git module installed.
- For Github users, this approach is good for storing tokens but using
  SSH keys is also fine if granular permissioning is not required.

### Syncing a fork with upstream

To sync a fork with upstream:

1. Configure a remote that points to the upstream repository.

   ```sh
   git remote add upstream \
     https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
   ```

   Check that the remote is configured properly using `git remote -v`.

   For more info, see the following
   [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork).

1. Fetch and merge upstream commits.

   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout master
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

   For more info, see the following
   [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).

Note that newer repositories have their primary branch names as `main`
instead of `master`.

* Syncing a fork with upstream
To sync a fork with upstream:
1. Configure a remote that points to the upstream repository.
2. Fetch and merge upstream commits.
** Configure remote pointing to upstream repository
See [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork][Github link]] for more information.
Note that newer repositories have their primary branch names ~main~ instead of ~master~.
#+begin_example
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
#+end_example
Check that the remote is configured using the following.
#+begin_example
git remote -v
#+end_example

See [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork][Github link]] for more information.

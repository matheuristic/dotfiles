# `launchp4merge` is used instead of `open -W -a APPNAME --args SOME ARGS`
# so going to the next file diff or merge only requires closing the window,
# see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33049253/is-it-possible-to-make-p4merge-quit-automatically-when-window-is-exited-on-mac-o
# and https://portal.perforce.com/s/article/2848

# modify the path to p4merge.app launchp4merge below as needed
# note that P4Merge does not support diffing directories, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/20135857

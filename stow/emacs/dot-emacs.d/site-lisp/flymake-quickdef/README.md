Quickly define a new [Flymake][flymake] backend

This package mainly defines `flymake-quickdef-backend`, a macro which
helps remove some of the boilerplate code from defining new Flymake
backend functions. The macro defines a function that is suitable to
register with Flymake and is similar in implementation to the
[example][example] in the Flymake manual.

New backend functions using the macro provide, minimally:

1. A Lisp form producing command line arguments for a program
2. A regular expression to search the process output
3. A Lisp form to convert the regex matches into Flymake diagnostics

The process of spawning the process and maintaining temporary files
and buffers is generated by the macro. The macro definitions work
similarly to [Flycheck's macro][fly-checker]. This makes it easier to
define Flymake diagnostics using external linters and other programs.

## Usage
Below is an example Flymake backend produced using the macro. It uses
[Bandit][bandit] to check Python source code and shows an example of
using a tool which requires a temporary file. The macro handles
creating the temporary file to reflect the (possibly unsaved) state of
the buffer, running the external process, and cleaning up.

```elisp
(require 'flymake-quickdef)

(flymake-quickdef-backend flymake-check-bandit
  :pre-let ((bandit-exec (executable-find "bandit")))
  :pre-check (unless bandit-exec (error "Cannot find bandit executable"))
  :write-type 'file
  :proc-form (list bandit-exec "--format" "custom" "--msg-template" "diag:{line} {severity} {test_id}: {msg}" fmqd-temp-file)
  :search-regexp "^diag:\\([[:digit:]]+\\) \\(HIGH\\|LOW\\|MEDIUM\\|UNDEFINED\\) \\([[:alpha:]][[:digit:]]+\\): \\(.*\\)$"
  :prep-diagnostic
  (let* ((lnum (string-to-number (match-string 1)))
         (severity (match-string 2))
         (code (match-string 3))
         (text (match-string 4))
         (pos (flymake-diag-region fmqd-source lnum))
         (beg (car pos))
         (end (cdr pos))
         (type (cond
                ((string= severity "HIGH") :error)
                ((string= severity "MEDIUM") :warning)
                (t :note)))
         (msg (format "%s (%s)" text code)))
    (list fmqd-source beg end type msg)))
```

Once the backend is defined, just arrange for it to be added to
`flymake-diagnostic-functions`, for example in a mode hook.

Note: if you use `flymake-quickdef-backend` in a package, always
unconditionally `(require 'flymake-quickdef)`, like in the example
(*not* just at compile time). This will ensure that supporting
definitions, like global variables, are made when the backend
functions run.

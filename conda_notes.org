#+TITLE: Conda Notes
* Anaconda vs Miniconda
Generally, use [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][Miniconda]] over [[https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/][Anaconda]] since the latter installs a lot of extraneous packages.
* Recommended workflow
- A new environment for Python package development or where package Python packages will be directly installed from [[https://pypi.org/][PyPI]] should first have ~pip~ installed via ~conda~.
- R environments installed via ~conda~ (via ~r-base~) on machines running Xcode 10+ (Mac OS X 10.14+) require the Clang compilation flags to be set appropriately, which can be done by copying ~.R/Makevars~ in this repository to ~.R/Makevars~ on the local machine.
- Within an environment, don't mix packages from the ~conda-forge~ and standard ~conda~ channels, use one of them and stick with it as far as possible for all conda installed packages in that environment.
* Duplicating environments
A conda environment can be saved via
#+begin_src sh
$ conda env export > environment.yaml
#+end_src
(change ~environment.yaml~ to another output file name as needed) and recreated via
#+begin_src sh
$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
#+end_src
*Note*: a saved environment lists the environment's name, its prefix path, conda channels and installed conda packages and their versions, but /not/ any packages installed via ~pip~ (those should be tracked in a separate file, typically ~requirements.txt~).

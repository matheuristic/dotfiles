* Application-specific configuration
** kitty
*** Using Option as Meta or Alt
- Set the ~macos_option_as_alt all~ option in the =~/.config/kitty.conf= file (replace ~left~ or ~right~ instead of ~all~ to only use the left or right Option key).
*** Syncing the kitty terminfo file to remote systems
- For a new server, options are to ssh in the first time with ~kitty +kitten ssh myserver~, to copy over the terminfo file with =infocmp xterm-kitty | ssh myserver tic -x -o \~/.terminfo /dev/stdin=, or to manually copy over the terminfo file to =~/.terminfo/x/xterm-kitty= on the server.
** MacPorts
***  Recommended packages

#+end_src
*** Migration process after upgrading to a new version of OS X
- See instructions [[https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration][here]].
** friendly interactive shell (fish)
*** Setup
- [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][fish]] can be installed via MacPorts.
- Set up terminal to use fish as the shell.
  - For [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][kitty]], in =~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf=, set the shell to the installed fish binary with the ~--login~ option, i.e. add the line ~shell /path/to/bin/fish --login~ (modify ~/path/to/bin/fish~ as necessary).
  - For [[https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac][Terminal]] or [[https://www.iterm2.com/][iterm2]], set up a profile that runs ~fish~ on start. For example, in the Terminal app open "Preferences > Profiles" and create a new profile, enable "Shell > Startup > Run Command" and set its value to the installed fish binary (with the ~--login~ option as necessary). Set the new profile as the default profile.
- [[https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher][fisher]] can be used to manage fish packages.
- If using the ~done~ fish package, install [[https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier][terminal-notifier]] for notifications with icons. Download a release bundle, unzip the app to some path (e.g. ~/path/to/terminal-notifier.app~), create the following wrapper script (change the path as is necessary) and put it in one of the ~$PATH~ directories:
#+begin_src
#!/bin/bash

# Wrapper for the terminal-notifier app
# https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier

/path/to/terminal-notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/terminal-notifier $@
#+end_src
*** Recommended packages
#+begin_src
franciscolourenco/done
jethrokuan/fzf
jethrokuan/z
jorgebucaran/fish-nvm
rafaelrinaldi/pure
#+end_src
** Clojure
- Clojure can be installed via MacPorts (install the ~clojure~ and one of the ~openjdk*~ packages). Java jar dependencies will be downloaded to =~/.m2= after running ~clojure~ the first time.
- For managing builds and dependencies, install ~lein~ which can be done manually. See the [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen website]] for instructions. Java jar dependencies will be downloaded to =~/.lein/self-installs=.
** TinyTex
*** Installation
- If using ~conda~, it's better to install via the command line ([[https://yihui.org/tinytex/#for-other-users][link]]).
- Install and remove packages using the ~tlmgr~ command line program ([[https://yihui.org/tinytex/#maintenance][link]]).
- Upgrading TexLive versions are easiest by fullying removing the =~/Library/TinyTex= directory and re-installing the currently installed packages which can be listed using ~tlmgr list | grep -e '^i' | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed -e 's/://g' | grep -v 'x86_64-darwin'~.
- If using the fish shell, add the following to the fish configuration file =~/.config/fish/config.fish= or a file it sources.
#+begin_src
# TinyTex
if test -d $HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin
    set PATH $HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin $PATH
end
#+end_src
*** Useful additional Tex packages
#+begin_src
biber
capt-of
fancyhdr
pgf
ulem
wrapfig
#+end_src
** R
*** Compiling C programs using Xcode 10+
- From Xcode 10 onwards (i.e. OS X 10.14 onwards), C headers are no longer installed to ~/usr/local/include~ rooted at the system root ~/~ by default.
- Headers are instead installed to a subsystem rooted at ~/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk~ (i.e. at ~/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include~).
- Compilation flags need to set to point to the approprate paths for R to properly compile C programs using Clang, e.g. see ~.R/Makevars~ file in this repository.
- For more information, see this [[https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/][blog post]].
- The above should be handled automatically in the [[https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/][official R installer]] but needs to be done manually for R installed by other means, e.g. installing ~r-base~ via [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][conda]].
* Usage tips
- ~Control-Command-Q~ locks the screen.

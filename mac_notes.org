* Application-specific configuration
** MacPorts
***  Recommended packages
#+begin_src
aspell
aspell-dict-en
autoconf
automake
bat
clojure
fish
fzf
htop
lftp
mosh
openjdk8 / openjdk11
qpdf
p7zip
ripgrep
rlwrap
starship
tmux
unrar
wget
xsv
#+end_src
*** Migration process after upgrading to a new version of OS X
- See instructions [[https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration][here]].
** friendly interactive shell (fish)
*** Setup
- [[https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell][fish]] can be installed via MacPorts.
- Set up a profile in [[https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac][Terminal]] (or [[https://www.iterm2.com/][iterm2]]) with "Shell > Startup > Run Command" enabled and set to the installed fish binary. Set it as the default profile.
- [[https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher][fisher]] can be used to manage fish packages.
*** Recommended packages
#+begin_src
fish-nvm
fzf
z
#+end_src
** Clojure
- Clojure can be installed via MacPorts (install the ~clojure~ and one of the ~openjdk*~ packages). Java jar dependencies will be downloaded to ~~/.m2~ after running ~clojure~ the first time.
- For managing builds and dependencies, install ~lein~ which can be done manually. See the [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen website]] for instructions. Java jar dependencies will be downloaded to ~~/.lein/self-installs~.
** R
*** Compiling C programs using Xcode 10+
- From Xcode 10 onwards (i.e. OS X 10.14 onwards), C headers are no longer installed to ~/usr/local/include~ rooted at the system root ~/~ by default.
- Headers are instead installed to a subsystem rooted at ~/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk~ (i.e. at ~/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include~).
- Compilation flags need to set to point to the approprate paths for R to properly compile C programs using Clang, e.g. see ~.R/Makevars~ file in this repository.
- For more information, see this [[https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/][blog post]].
- The above should be handled automatically in the [[https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/][official R installer]] but needs to be done manually for R installed by other means, e.g. installing ~r-base~ via [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][conda]].
* Usage tips
- ~Control-Command-Q~ locks the screen.

# acmeed is a stand-in application designed to be used as $EDITOR; it is designed to integrate with (p9p) acme on *nix systems.
# When invoked by a command such as `git commit`, acme creates a new row displaying the temporary file for editing.
# 'Putdel' confirms the write and deletes the window. 'Del' cancels the operation.
